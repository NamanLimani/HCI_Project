# HCI_Project

## TODO:
Frontend:
- Make inline highlight hovering feature.
- make a better loading animation
- fix pdf formatting
- make it work when having multiple articles open and switching between them without having to reload
- add local history

Backend:
- maybe make it find more than one source for each claim by default?
- add a source reputability analysis & score for each source link (in the full analysis tab)
- Make the deep research feature in the full analysis tab. 
- Make AI authorship analysis more accurate. Different API maybe? Since I've found even GPTZero to be pretty inaccurate in a lot of cases, this feature might not be feasible
- Ability to switch between different AI apis in the settings tab. Nice to have and helps us stay within free-tier limits of different services.
